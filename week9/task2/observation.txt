All plots have Serial fragment set to 0.1%

### Task 2-1: Increasing network utilization
Increasing network utilization value decreases speedup in a quite linear fashion.
What I mean by 'linear fashion' is that the interval between each plot of maximum achieved speedup value is almost equal.

For instance, with util=0.2 and num_cpu=128, speedup equals to around 90.
Util=0.3 gives us a speedup value of around 78 (-12 from previous).
Util=0.4 gives us a speedup value of around 65 (-13 from previous).

Therefore, I think the behaviour is quite predictable.


### Task 2-2: Increasing the delay factor
Increasing the delay factor means that there are more than one packets / data in the packet-switch.
This leads to an additional queueing delay for data transfer.

When we have 0.02 df, we don't see any big difference compared to 0.01df. However, after multiplying the value
several times up to 0.16, the speedup values become incredibly slow.

Although both delay factor and network utilization slow down the system's performance, I think delay factor
incurs higher cost and reduction in system performance.

### Conclusion
From the two experiments between Amdahl's law, it is true that good Sppedup value can be achieved when:
- the delay is low, this means that the number of messages need to be reduced.
- the network utilization is low
- the serial fragments do not overpower the parallel fragments
